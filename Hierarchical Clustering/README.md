## Hierarchical Clustring
In this approach each point in the given data set firstly will be considered a cluster then one by one the closest points are merged until we reach to only one cluster.

As an obvious advantage of hierarchical clustering, we can consider its advntage on K-means which does not require to determine the number of the clusters.
